`react-konva` is a JavaScript library for drawing complex canvas graphics using [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/). It provides declarative and reactive bindings to the [Konva Framework](https://konvajs.org/).


[Github Repo](https://github.com/lavrton/react-konva)


It is an attempt to make [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) work with the HTML5 canvas library. The goal is to have a similar declarative markup as normal React and also a similar data-flow model.

**Currently, `react-konva` is not supported in the React Native environment.**

Currently you can use all `Konva` nodes and shapes as React components and all `Konva` events are supported on them in the same way.

**Note: you can find a lot of demos and examples for using Konva there: [https://konvajs.org/](https://konvajs.org/). Really, just go there and take a look at what Konva can do for you. You will be able to do the same with react-konva, too. `Konva` for `react-konva` is like DOM for `React`.**

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-konva konva --save
```

## Comparisons

### react-konva vs react-canvas

[react-canvas](https://github.com/Flipboard/react-canvas) is a completely
different react plugin. It allows you to draw DOM-like objects (images, texts)
on canvas elements in a very performant way. It is NOT designed for drawing graphics, but
react-konva serves exactly this purpose: drawing complex graphics on a `<canvas>` element from within
React.

### react-konva vs react-art

[react-art](https://github.com/reactjs/react-art) allows you to draw graphics on
a page. It also supports SVG output. However, it has no support of events on
shapes.

### react-konva vs vanilla canvas

Vanilla canvases can be faster since `react-konva` comes with two layers of abstractions: (1) The `Konva` framework is on top of canvas and (2) `React` is on top of `Konva`. For many applications its performance is still very good. The purpose of `react-konva` is to reduce the complexity of your application and to use a well-known declarative way for drawing on canvases.
